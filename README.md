# Unbeatable AI Tic Tac Toe

## Description
This project implements an unbeatable AI for the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. 

## Features
- Implements the classic Tic Tac Toe game.
- Unbeatable AI strategy based on the minimax algorithm.
- Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `tictactoe.py` file using Python 3.

```bash
python tictactoe.py
```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play against the unbeatable AI.
5. Enjoy the game and try to beat the unbeatable!

## Rules
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Ai starts the game with X symbol.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If the board is full and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

## AI Strategy
The AI uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best move to make in any given situation. It evaluates all possible moves and their potential outcomes, assuming the opponent plays optimally as well. By choosing the move that leads to the best possible outcome or prevents the opponent from winning, the AI ensures it is unbeatable.
